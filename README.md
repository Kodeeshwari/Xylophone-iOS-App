# Xylophone

## Goal

The goal of this task is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great programmer is being able to solve your own problems. I'll do that by exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively.

## What I Created

I created first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So in this task, I am going to make a colourful XyloPhone app.
